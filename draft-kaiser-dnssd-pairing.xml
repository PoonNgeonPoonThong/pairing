        <t>
          This document proposes a device pairing mechanism that establishes a relationship between two devices by
          agreeing on a secret and manually verifying the secret's authenticity.
          Pairing has to be performed only once per pair of devices, as for a re-discovery at any later point in time,
          the exchanged secret can be used for mutual authentication.
        </t>
        <t>
          The proposed pairing method is suited for each application area where human operated devices need to establish a
          relation that allows configurationless and privacy preserving re-discovery at any later point in time.
          Since privacy preserving applications are the main suitors, we especially care about privacy.
        </t>

<section title="Introduction">
  <t>
  To engage in secure and privacy preserving communication, hosts need to differentiate
  between authorized peers, which must both know about the host's presence and be able to decrypt messages sent by the host,
  and other peers, which must not be able to decrypt the host's messages and ideally should  not be aware of the host's presence.
  The necessary relationship between host and peer can be established by a centralized service, e.g. a certificate  authority,
  by a web of trust, e.g. PGP, or -- without using global identities -- by device pairing.
  </t>
  
  <t>
    This document proposes a device pairing mechanism that provides human operated devices with pairwise authenticated secrets,
    allowing mutual automatic re-discovery at any later point in time along with mutual private authentication.
    We especially care about privacy and user-friendliness.
  </t>

  <t>
    The proposed pairing mechanism consists of three steps needed to establish a relationship between a host and a peer:
  </t>

  <t>
<list style="numbers">
<t>
   Discovery of the peer device. The host needs a means to discover network parameters necessary to establish a connection to the peer.
   The host must not disclose its presence or any other information about the intended pairing to any other peer.
</t>
<t>
  Agreeing on pairing data. The devices have to agree on pairing data, which can be used by both parties at any later point in time to
  generate identifiers for re-discovery and to prove the authenticity of the pairing.
  The pairing data can e.g. be a shared secret agreed upon leveraging a Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
</t>
<t>
  Authenticate pairing data. Since in most cases the messages necessary to agree upon pairing data are send over an insecure channel, 
  the authenticity of these messages has to be guaranteed; otherwise the pairing data is not suited as a means for a later proof of authenticity.
  For the proposed pairing mechanism we use manual interaction to proof the authenticity of the pairing data.

<section title="Requirements">
<t>
  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119" />.
</t>
</section>
</section>


<section title="Problem statement" anchor="problem" >
<t>
The general pairing requirement is easy to state: establish a trust relation between two entities in a 
secure manner. But details matter, and in this section we explore the detailed requirements that guide
our design.
</t>

<section title="Secure Pairing Over Internet Connections" anchor="securityReq" >
<t>
Many pairing protocols have been already developed, in particular for the
pairing of devices over specific wireless networks. For example, the current BlueTooth 
specifications include a pairing protocol that has evolved over several
revisions towards better security and usability <xref target="BTLEPairing" />.
The Wi-Fi Alliance defined the Wi-Fi Protected Setup process to ease the setup of 
security-enabled Wi-Fi networks in home and small office environments 
<xref target="WPS" />. Other wireless standards have defined or are defining similar
protocols, tailored to specific technologies.
</t>
<t>
This specification defines a pairing protocol that is independent of the underlying 
technology. We simply make the hypothesis that the two parties engaged in the pairing
can discover each other and can exchange establish connections over IP.   
</t>
<t>
TODO: discuss the actual goal. Is it a shared secret or a public key?
</t>
</section>

<section title="Identity Assurance" anchor="verifyId" >
<t>
The parties in the pairing must be able to identify each other. To put it simply, if Alice believes 
that she is establishing a pairing with Bob, she must somehow ensure that the pairing is happening
with Bob, and not with some interloper like Eve or Nessie. Providing this assurance requires care at
the user interface (UI), and also in the design of the protocol.
</t>
<t>
Consider for example an attack in 
which Eve tricks Alice into establishing a pairing, and then pretends to be Bob. Alice must be able 
to discover that something is wrong, and refuse to establish a pairing. To do this,
the UI needs to display the name of the parties beeing paired. (Discuss: what kind of name? Is it 
exchanged a part of the protocol?) At a minimum, the parties engaged in the pairing must be able
to verify the identity under which the pairing is established. 
</t>
</section>

<section title="Adequate user interface" anchor="MITMUIReq" >
<t>
Because the pairing protocol is executed without prior knowledge, it is typically vulnerable to
"Man-in-the-middle" attacks. While Alice is trying to establish a pairing with Bob, Eve positions 
herself in the middle. Instead of getting a pairing between Alice and Bob, Alice gets 
paired with Eve, and Eve with Bob. This requires specific features in the protocol to 
detect man-in-the-middle attacks, and if possible resist them. The reference <xref target="NR11" /> 
analyzes the various proposals to solve this problem, and in this document, we present 
a layman description of these issues in <xref target="MITMCryptoReq" />. The
various protocols proposed in the litterature impose diverse constraints at the UI
interface, which we will review here.
</t>
<section title="Short PIN proved inadequate" >
<t>
The initial Bluetooth pairing protocol relied on four digit PIN. The device to be paired
would display a pin. The user would read that pinand provide it to the pairing device.
The pin would then be used in a Password Authenticated Key Exchange. There was
a similar option in Wi-Fi Protected Setup <xref target="WPS" />. There were
various attacks against the actual protocol. Some were caused by issues
in the protocol, but most of the problems are tied 
to the usability of short PINs.
</t>
<t>
In the reference implementation, the pin is picked at random by the paired device before
the beginning of the exchange. But this requires that the paired device be capable of
generating and displaying a four digit number. It turns out that many devices cannot do
that. For example, an audio headset does not have any display capability. These limited
devices ended up using static pins, with fixed values like "0000" or "0001". 
</t>
<t>
Even when the paired device could display a random pin, that pin will have to be copied
by the user on the pairing device. It turns out that users do not like copying long
series of numbers, and the usability thus dictated that the pins be short -- four digits
in practice. But there is only so much assurance that can be derived from a four digit
key.
</t>
<t>
It is interesting to note that the latest revisions of the Bluetooth Pairing protocol 
<xref target="BTLEPairing" /> do not anymore include the short PIN option. The 
PIN entry methods have been superceded by the simple "just works" method for devices
without displays, and by a procedure based on "short authentication strings" when
displays are available.
</t>

</section>

<section title="Push buttons just work, but are insecure" >
<t>
Some devices are unable to input or display any code. The industry more or less
converged on a "push button" solution. When the button is pushed, devices enter
a "pairing" mode, during which they will accept a pairing request from whatever 
other device connects to them.
</t>
<t>
The Bluetooth Pairing protocol <xref target="BTLEPairing" /> denotes that as 
the "just works" method. It does indeed work, and if the pairing succeeds
the devices will later be able to use the pairing keys to authenticate connections.
However, the procedure does not provide any protection against
MITM attacks during the pairing process. The only protection is that pushing the
button will only allow pairing for a limited time, thus limiting the
opportunities of attacks.
</t>
<t>
As we set up to define a pairing protocol with a briad set of applications,
we cannot limit ourselves to an insecure "push button" method. But we probably
need to allow for a mode of operation that works for input-limited
and display limited devices.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Short range communication">
<t>
There have been several attempts to define pairing protocols that use "secure
channels." Most of them are based on short range communication systems,
where the short range limits the feasibility for attackers to access the channels.
Example of such limited systems include for example:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols" >
<t>
QR codes, displayed on the screen of one device, and read by the camera of the other device.
</t>
<t>
Near Field Communication (NFC) systems, which provides wireless communication with a very short range.
</t>
<t>
Sound systems, in which one systems emits a sequence of sounds or ultrasounds that is picked by the microphone of the other system.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
A common problem with these solutions is that they require special capabilities that may not be present in every device. 
Another problem is that they are often one-way channels. And another problem is that the side channel is not
necessarily secret. QR codes could be read by third parties. Powerful radios antennas might be able to interfere with 
NFC. Sensitive microphones might pick the sounds.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Short authentication strings" >
<t>
The evolving pairing protocols seem to converge towards a "display and compare" method. 
This is in line with academic studies, such as <xref target="KFR09" /> or <xref target="USK11" />.
This point to a very simple scenario:
</t>
<t>
<list style="numbers">
<t>
Alice initiates pairing
</t>
<t>
Bob selects Alice's device from a list.
</t>
<t>
Alice and Bob compare displayed strings that represent a fingerprint of the key.
</t>
<t>
If the strings match, Alice and Bob accept the pairing.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
Most existing pairing protocols display the fingerprint of the key as a 6 or 7 digit
numbers. Usability studies show that gives good results, with little risk that
users mistakenly accept two different numbers as matching. However, the authors of 
<xref target="USK11" /> found that people had more success comparing computer 
generated sentences than comparing numbers. This is in line with the argument in
<xref target="XKCD936" /> to use sequences of randomly chosen common words as passwords. 
On the other hand, standardizing strings is more complicated than standardizing numbers.
We would need to specify a list of common words, and the process to go from a binary 
fingerprint to a set of words. We would need to be concerned with internationalization 
issues, such as using different lists of words in German and in English. This could
require negotiation of word lists or languages inside the pairing protocols. 
</t>
<t>
In contrast, numbers are easy to specify, as in "take a 20 bit number and 
display it as an integer using decimal notation."
</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="Resist cryptographic attacks" anchor="MITMCryptoReq" >
<t>
It is tempting to believe that once two peers are connected, they could create
a secret with a few simple steps, such as for example exchange two nonces, 
hash the concatenation of this nonces with the shared secret, display
a short authentication string composed of a short version of that hash 
on each device, and verify that that the two values match. The sequence
of messages would be something like:
</t>
<t>
<figure>
<artwork>
    Alice                       Bob
    g^xA --&gt;
                           &lt;-- g^xB
    nA --&gt;
                              &lt;-- nB
    Computes              Computes
    s = g^xAxB            s = g^xAxB
    h = hash(s|nA|nB)     h = hash(s|nA|nB)
    Displays short        Displays short
    version of h          version of h
</artwork>
</figure>
</t>
<t>
If the two short hashes match, Alice and Bob are supposedly assured that
they have computed the same secret, but there is a problem.
The exchange may not deter a smart attacker
in the middle. Let's redraw the same message flow, this time involving Eve:
</t>
<t>
<figure>
<artwork>
    Alice                Eve                Bob
    g^xA --&gt;
                         g^xA'--&gt;
                                        &lt;-- g^xB
                      &lt;--g^xB'
    nA --&gt;
                         nA --&gt; 
                                          &lt;-- nB
                       Picks nB'
                       smartly
                      &lt;--nB'
    Computes                             Computes
    s' = g^xAxB'                           s" = g^xA'xB
    h' = hash(s|nA|nB')                    h" = hash(s"|nA|nB)
    Displays short                       Displays short
    version of h'                        version of h"
</artwork>
</figure>
</t>
<t>
Let's now assumes that to pick the nonce nB' smartly, Eve runs the following
algorithm:
</t>
<t>
<figure>
<artwork>
    s' = g^xAxB'
    s" = g^xA'xB
    repeat
       pick a new version of nB'
       h' = hash(s|nA|nB')
       h" = hash(s"|nA|nB)
    until the short version of h' 
    matches the short version of h"
</artwork>
</figure>
</t>
<t>
Of course, running this algorithm will require in theory as many iterations as
the possible values of the short hash. But hash algorithms are fast, and it
is possible to try millions of values in less than a second. If the short
string is made up of fewer than 6 digits, Eve will find a matching nonce 
quickly, and Alice and Bob will hardly notice the delay. Even if the 
matching string is as long as 8 letters, Eve will probably find a value
where the short versions of h' and h" are close enough, e.g. start and end
with the same two or three letters. Alice and Bob may well be fooled.
</t>
<t>
The classic solution to such problems is to "commit" the value of the hash
before sending it. In the modified exchange, Alice and Bob exchange a secure
hash of their nonces before sending the actual value:
</t>
<t>
<figure>
<artwork>
    Alice                       Bob
    g^xA --&gt;
                            &lt;-- g^xB
    hash(nA) --&gt;
                        &lt;-- hash(nB)
    nA --&gt;
                              &lt;-- nB
    Computes              Computes
    s = g^xAxB            s = g^xAxB
    verifies hash(nB)     verifies hash(nA)
    h = hash(s|nA|nB)     h = hash(s|nA|nB)
    Displays short        Displays short
    version of h          version of h
</artwork>
</figure>
</t>
<t>
Alice will only disclose nA after receiving hash(nB) and
having confirmation from Bob that hash(nA) has been received, and
similarly Bob will only disclose nB after receiving hash(nA) and
having confirmation from Bob that hash(nB) has been received.
At that point, Eve has a problem. She can still forge the values of the nonces
but she needs to pick the nonce nB' before the actual value of nB has been 
disclosed. On first sight, it seems that once she has committed by sending
hash(nB'), it will be impossible to send anything but the nB'. Eve would
still have a random chance of fooling Alice and Bob, but it will be a very
small chance: one in million if the short authentication string is made of
6 digits, even fewer if that string is longer. Bob and Alice should
be safe. There is still a theoretical problem, but only if Eve is way more powerful
than the average attacker.
</t>
<t>
Suppose that Eve has access to almost infinite budgets, and gets help from 
very smart cryptographers. Alice and Bob don't know that, but Eve has been
able to generate hash collisions. She has access to a special hash value,
which we will note hash(magic),
and to a large number of nonces that all hash to that same special value.
Building that catalog took lots of resource, but for Eve that's a great
investment, because it could be used for multiple attacks. She can use
it each time Alice tries to create a pairing with Bob, or in fact when
anyone tries to do that. The attack will work as follow:
</t>
<t>
<figure>
<artwork>
    Alice                Eve                Bob
    g^xA --&gt;
                         g^xA'--&gt;
                                        &lt;-- g^xB
                      &lt;--g^xB'
    hash(nA) --&gt;
                         hash(nA) --&gt;
                                     &lt;-- hash(nB)
                     &lt;-- hash(magic)
    nA --&gt;
                         nA --&gt; 
                                          &lt;-- nB
                       Picks nB'
                       smartly
                      &lt;--nB'
    Computes                             Computes
    s' = g^xAxB'                           s" = g^xA'xB
    verifies hash(nB)                      verifies hash(nA)
    h' = hash(s|nA|nB')                    h" = hash(s"|nA|nB)
    Displays short                       Displays short
    version of h'                        version of h"
</artwork>
</figure>
</t>
<t>
The way Eve picks nB smartly is by iterating through the hashes in its
catalog of values that hash to the same "magic" value:
</t>
<t>
<figure>
<artwork>
    s' = g^xAxB'
    s" = g^xA'xB
    repeat
       pick a new version of nB' *from the catalog*
       h' = hash(s|nA|nB')
       h" = hash(s"|nA|nB)
    until the short version of h' 
    matches the short version of h"
</artwork>
</figure>
</t>
<t>
That may be a far fetched attack, but there are a couple of ways to protect
against it. The first way is to constrain the nonces to be exactly the 
same length as resulting hash. Most collision finders require long input 
strings; they typically do not work well for strings that are not longer 
than the hash itself. The other way is to insert in the hash a component
that will be different at every exchange, making Eve's pre-computed
catalog useless. The modified algorithm would thus be:
</t>
<t>
<figure>
<artwork>

This combination will prove very hard for Eve to attack. In practice, it will
require breaking either the hash function or the Diffie Hellman exchange. 
We will require that our pairing protocol incorporates this design.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Privacy Requirements" >
<t>
Snooping. Eve listens to the traffic on the network, and discovers that Alice is paired with Bob. 
She may also discover private identifiers used by Alice and Bob, such as the values of public 
keys, that can then be used later to track Alice or Bob.
</t>
<t>
TODO: point out that anything sent before the MITM defense can be obtained by the attacker.
The displayed PIN will not match, the parties will abort the attempt, but if identities 
are exchanged before consensus, the attacker will learn that Alice and Bob tried to
establish a pairing. That can be bad.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Robustness" >
<t>
Denial of service. Eve prevents Alice and Bob from establishing a pairing. This happens if
the protocol is easy to identify.
</t>
</section>

</section> <!-- end of problem statement -->

<section title="Design" anchor="design" >

<t>
  In this section we discuss the design of pairing protocols that use manually verified short authentication strings (SAS).
  Nguyen et al. <xref target="NR11" /> survey these protocols and compare them with respect to the amount of necessary user interaction and
  the computation time needed on the devices.
  The authors state that such a protocol is optimal with respect user interaction if it suffices for users to verify a single b-bit SAS
  while having a one-shot attack success probability of 2^-b.
  Further, n consecutive attacks on the protocol must not have a better success probability then n one-shot attacks.
</t>

<t>
  TODO Should I detail attacks and success probabilities from a theoretical/abstract point of view?
</t>

<t>
  We divide pairing in three parts: discovery, agreement, and authentication, detailed in the following subsections.
</t>

<section title="Discovery">

</section>

<section title="Agreement">
<t>
  Diffie-Hellman
</t>
</section>

<section title="Authentication">
<t>
 Commitment
 SAS: shown on the display and acknowledged by the users.
 SAS: shown by one user and input by the other
</t>
<t>
  Long Authentication String: If devices support QR code scanning, we can use  80bits:
  hash(g^ab || nonce) where.
</t>

</section>


<section title="Intra User Pairing">
  <t>
  Users can pair their own devices in secure (home) networks without any interaction using a special DNS-SD pairing service.
  </t>
  <t>
    USB
  </t>

</section>

<section title="Pairing Data Synchronization">
  <t>
    To make it sufficient for users to pair only one of their devices to one of their friends devices while still
    being able to engage in later communication with all of this friend's devices with any of the own devices,
    we offer the possibility to synchronize pairing data among devices of the same user.
    Pairing data synchronization is performed via a special DNS-SD service (_pdsync._tls).
  </t>
</section>




<section title="Public Authentication Keys">
  <t>
    Should we discuss public authentication keys whose fingerprints are verified during pairing?
</t>
</section>

</section>


<section title="Solution" anchor="solution" >

<t>
  TODO
</t>

<section title="Discovery">
<t>
  DNS-SD <xref target="RFC6763" /> over mDNS <xref target="RFC6762" /> (_pairing._tcp) using an instance name the
  users agreed upon.

</t>
<t>
<xref target="RFC6189" />. ZTRP uses a commited DH exchange pairing method
</t>


<t>
  Most efficient with respect to both, minimizing user interactoin (meaning minimizing the SAS that has the be veriyfied) and
  the calculations the device has to be performed, is the improved Hoepman protocol <xref target="NR11" /> :

<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>
  TODO
</t>

<t>
There are a variety of attacks against pairing systems. They
may result in compromised pairing keys.
the compromised pairing.
</t>
<t>
To mitigate such attacks, nodes MUST be able to quickly revoke
a compromised pairing. This is however not sufficient, as the
compromise of the pairing key could remain undetected for
a long time. For further safety, nodes SHOULD assign a time limit
to the validity of pairings, discard the corresponding keys when
the time has passed, and establish new pairings.
</t>
<t>
This later requirement of limiting the Time-To-Live can raise
doubts about the usability of the protocol. The usability issues
would be mitigated if the initial pairing provided both
a shared secret and the means to renew that secret over time,
e.g. using authenticated public keys.
